## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lookout.git
cd lookout
```

### 2. Set up virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Optional: Use `env_lookout_frozen.yml` if you're managing with Conda.

### 3. Configure secrets

Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file or use Streamlit CLI to store:

```toml
AMBIENT_API_KEY = "..."
AMBIENT_APPLICATION_KEY = "..."
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "..."
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "..."
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the Streamlit dashboard

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Run the catchup CLI script

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python lookout/cli/catchup.py
```

Use with cron (with logging + jitter):

```bash
lookout/bin/cron_run.sh --sleep 300 lookout/cli/catchup.py
```
